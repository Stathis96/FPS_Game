# FPS_Game
Completed FPS game and presented it as my Thesis for the completion of my studies at the International Hellenic University *(Department of Information and Electronic Engineering*).
The game is written in C# using the Unity Game engine.
It's assets are acquired exclusively from Unity's Asset Store, with minor changes to their graphic content through Blender.
It also gave me the chance to participate in University's Top Thesis' of the year 2021 as it was graded with 100/100 from all the members of the Î•xamination Committee.
The event will be held in November 2021, and best thesis will also get a reward.
